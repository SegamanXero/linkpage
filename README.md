Personal social media link tree webpage.

# About
Linked the idea of a link tree, which agregates various links that a user is registered into one cohesive place. I wanted to build this from scratch so I can practice my html and css skill. Also took elements from a unreleased prototype fork from my website.

# Resources
w3schools is very informative, I want to thank them for being educational tool that is available to see how things work and stuff.

# Todo
Will put a binary with blank template in the release section at some point for people to use.
